# ClaimsAuth
A generic claims based access control system ASP.NET MVC 5 with Identity 2.0.

The method I explain here will be useful for applications with moderate complexity, which would require an end user (an admin) to define which resources a particular user has access to. 

Code follows following the blog post series: [ASP.NET MVC Fine Grained Identity & Access Control - Part 1](http://blog.dinklabs.com/2015/11/mvc-fine-grained-identity-access-control-1.html) 

This is developed using VS2015. MVC sample project with WebAPI turned on + Individual User Accounts.

*How to get it working:*
 
 1. Enable 'Nuget Package Restore'
 2. Build
 3. Run
